START. What was leaving HellRaisers like for you, from your point of you and what is your outlook going forward from that point?Seems similar to when STYKO left the team, or at least to what he said when he left, that he was stuck in some roles, couldn't change them and no one wanted to adapt...You've been playing with HellRaisers for quite some time, does leaving the team, for good this time, bring some feelings with it?What is your outlook moving from here, do you have anything lined up, did you have any offers?To hear about his departure from HellRaisers and his few days with Gambit, we sat down with Vladyslav "bondik" Nechyporchuk at SuperNova CS:GO Malta.
